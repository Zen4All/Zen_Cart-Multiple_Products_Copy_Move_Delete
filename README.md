# Zen-Cart_Multiple-Products-Copy-Move-Delete

Based on
https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?180447-Multiple-Products-(Copy-Move-Delete)

Current Status:
Fileset has not (yet) been prepared as a complete plugin, intended as a quick and dirty solution for users who already have this installed.
Apparently it is working on php 7.3.10 and Zen Cart 1.5.6. but NOT TESTED.

USE AT OWN RISK - TEST THOROUGHLY ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER

Please report all bugs here.

The plan is to clean this up and submit to Zen Cart 1.5.7, time permitting....
